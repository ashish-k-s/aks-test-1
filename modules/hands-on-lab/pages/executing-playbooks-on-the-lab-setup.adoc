#  Executing playbooks on the lab setup

== Hands-on Lab > Executing Playbooks on the Lab Setup

Executing playbooks is a crucial skill to master when working with Ansible. In this section, we will guide you through running your playbooks against the lab setup you've created for practice.

### Prerequisites

Before executing playbooks on your lab environment, ensure that:

1. You have set up a lab environment as described in [Setting up a lab environment for practice](#setting-up-a-lab-environment-for-practice).
2. Ansible is installed and configured correctly on your control node as outlined in [Installing and configuring Ansible](#installing-and-configuring-ansible).
3. You have written simple playbooks for basic tasks, following the instructions in [Playbooks Basics](#playbooks-basics).

### Steps to Execute Playbooks

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt** on your control node where Ansible is installed.

2. **Navigate to the directory** containing your playbook(s). For example:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ansible-lab/playbooks
   ```

3. **Execute the playbook** using the `ansible-playbook` command followed by the playbook filename. For instance, if your playbook is named `basic_tasks.yml`, run:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook basic_tasks.yml
   ```

   This command will execute all tasks defined in your playbook against the specified hosts (managed nodes) in your inventory file.

4. **Monitor the output** as Ansible runs the playbook. You will see detailed information about each task's status, any changes made, and potential errors.

   Example:

   ```
   PLAY [Local connection check] *************************************************************

   TASK [Gathering Facts] **************************************************************************
   ok: [192.168.56.101]

   TASK [Start Apache service] *************************************************************************
   changed: [192.168.56.101]

   PLAY RECAP **************************************************************************************
   192.168.56.101             : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    total=3       ->
   ```

5. **Analyze results and debug failures** if any tasks fail during execution. Inspect the task output for error messages, and consult Ansible's documentation or online resources to address the issues. Common failure causes include incorrect syntax in your playbook, missing modules, or failed connection attempts due to misconfigured host details.

6. **Repeat the process** with different playbooks or modifying existing ones to practice varying configurations and troubleshooting scenarios.

### Additional Tips

- Use the `-v` (verbose) or `-VV` (very verbose) flag with `ansible-playbook` for more detailed output during execution, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues.

  Example:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -v basic_tasks.yml
  ```

- Leverage Ansible's built-in variables and filters to make your playbooks more dynamic and reusable across different environments.

- Explore advanced features such as handlers, roles, and templates to create sophisticated automation solutions.

By following these steps and practicing with various scenarios, you will become proficient in executing Ansible playbooks on your lab setup and tackle real-world automation challenges effectively.
