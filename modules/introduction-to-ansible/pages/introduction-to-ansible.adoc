#  Introduction to Ansible

- **What is Ansible?** Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It employs a simple language (YAML) to describe system configurations, making it accessible for users without deep IT backgrounds.
   - **Use Cases**: Common use cases include server provisioning, application deployment, and managing system configurations across multiple machines.
   - **Installation and Configuration**: Ansible is installed on a control node, typically a management workstation or server. It does not require any additional agents on the managed nodes (servers or workstations), communicating with them via SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows).

This brief introduction sets the stage for understanding Ansible's role in automation tasks and prepares users for detailed exploration of its architecture, playbooks, and hands-on practice.
